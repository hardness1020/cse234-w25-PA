    The fusion operators combine multiple operators (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) into a single 
kernel to optimize workflow. The intuition includes reducing the overhead of intermediate data transfers between operations 
and the time of kernel launching. The reason is that many computations can be executed more efficiently when grouped.
Fusing operators reduces the overhead of launching multiple kernels, and the intermediate data is stored in the GPU
memory, which is faster than transferring data between the CPU and GPU. The fusion operators can be implemented differently, 
such as using a library that supports fusion operators or manually writing the code to fuse operators. Future improvements
to these operators could include optimizing the fusion process to specific model architectures like Transformer and diffusion model,
hardware accelerators like TPUs and GPUs, and dynamic operators during runtime.
